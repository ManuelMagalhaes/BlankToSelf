# NoBlank

This is a simple Chrome extension that replaces the "\_blank" from target attribute of anchor elements with "\_self".

I developed this because I personally dislike having a new tab/window opened when I don't expect it to happen. Not saying there aren't good reasons to use \_blank, it's just that I often find cases that I rather not have it.
