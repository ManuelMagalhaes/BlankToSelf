# BlankToSelf

This is a simple extension for Firefox and Chrome that replaces the "\_blank" from target attribute of anchor elements with "\_self".

To use it, define in the extensions options which sites you'd like to apply the extension to. (caveat: at the moment, the extension works domain-wide, no regex implemented at the moment)

I developed this because I personally dislike having a new tab/window opened when I don't expect it to happen. Not saying there aren't good reasons to use \_blank, it's just that I often find cases that I rather not have it.
